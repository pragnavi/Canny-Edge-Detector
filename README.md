# Exploring Canny Edge Detection: Implementation and Analysis

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm, a cornerstone technique in the field of image processing. It includes a Python script for applying the algorithm to various images, processed images showcasing each step of the algorithm, and a detailed project report.

## Contents
- `canny.py`: The Python implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.
- `Histogram Images with Threshold Marked`: Contains histograms of images with threshold values marked, aiding in the understanding of threshold selection.
- Processed Images: A collection of BMP images documenting the process of Canny Edge Detection across different stages and thresholds on three sample images (Barbara, Goldhill, Peppers).
- `Canny_Edge_Detector_Project_Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, implementation, results, and analysis of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system, along with necessary libraries (if any specific libraries are needed, consider including a `requirements.txt` file in future repository updates).
3. Run `canny.py` to apply the Canny Edge Detection algorithm to your images or explore the included sample images and their processed results.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the implementation, expand the dataset, or improve the documentation are welcome. Feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
